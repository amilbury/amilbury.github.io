            I am from Saint John New Brunswick. I am currently
            enrolled in the ITPA(Information Technology Programmer Analyst)
            Program. Through this program I have developed skills in different
            areas of programming, as follows.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Database Design and Programming</li>
            <li>Object Oriented Programming in C# and Java</li>
            <li>PHP Programming</li>
            <li>Fullstack development in Javascript</li>
            <li>Quality Assurance Testing</li>
            <li>Project Management</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Through my studies I have gained a lot of experience in the fields
            above as well as others. See the projects tab for more information
            on the specifics.

            <h3>
              Here are a couple of projects I have worked on
            </h3>
            <a href="https://github.com/JPellet123/Javascript_Quiz_App"><h2>Javascript Quiz App</h2></a>
            <p>I wrote a quiz app with my school partner Jared Pelletier. This app allowed you to select any quiz you would like from the list, 
              go through the actual quiz, and then give you a grade based on your answers.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/amilbury/OOP_Project"><h2>C# Object Oriented Programming Final</h2></a>
            <p>This project uses many different object oriented principles to create a carting system, where the user can enter in different items into a cart, checkout, and print a reciept.
              The admin can also alter the products if the user entered is an admin. Jared Pelletier also worked on this project.
            </p>
              <a href="https://github.com/amilbury/JavaServletsAndJSP"><h2>Java servlet's and JSP</h2></a>
              <p>In Java we wrote a collection of servlets and jsp's for a simple monitor store where the user can add items to their cart and checkout.</p>

            <h3><i>Volunteering</i></h3>
            <h4>Engage 4 Change Research Project</h4>
            <i>Counselor</i>
            <p>
              At Engage 4 Change I and a few other NBCC students had the
              opportunity to volunteer with the federally funded organization to
              help kids in priority neighborhoods learn how to code.
