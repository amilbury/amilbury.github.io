            I am Aaron Milbury, from Saint John New Brunswick. I am currently
            enrolled in the ITPA(Information Technology Programmer Analyst)
            Program. Through this program I have developed skills in different
            areas of programming, as follows.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Database Design and Programming</li>
            <li>Object Oriented Programming in C# and Java</li>
            <li>PHP Programming</li>
            <li>Fullstack development in Javascript</li>
            <li>Quality Assurance Testing</li>
            <li>Project Management</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Through my studies I have gained a lot of experience in the fields
            above as well as others. See the projects tab for more information
            on the specifics.

            I have worked on many projects since starting at NBCC. Here are a
            few of them:

          <li>C#</li>
          <li>PHP</li>

          <h3><i>Volunteering</i></h3>
          <h4>Engage 4 Change Research Project</h4>
          <i>Counselor</i>
          <p>
            At Engage 4 Change I and a few other NBCC students had the
            opportunity to volunteer with the federally funded organization to
            help kids in priority neighborhoods learn how to code.
